  - Explain concept of error/loss
  - Show how feedback improves models
quiz:
  - q: What does "loss" measure?
    options: ["Data size","Error between prediction and reality","Model complexity","Number of parameters"]
    answer: 1
    explain: Loss quantifies prediction error.
flashcards:
  - Loss Function: Metric of model error
  - Gradient Descent: Process to reduce error
reflection:
  - "Have you seen systems improve with feedback (e.g., Netflix, autocorrect)?"
