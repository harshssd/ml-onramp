quiz:
  - q: Which model is best suited for image classification?
    options: ["Logistic Regression","Random Forest","Neural Network","Decision Tree"]
    answer: 2
    explain: Neural networks excel at complex pattern recognition tasks like image classification due to their ability to learn hierarchical features.
  - q: Why might Random Forests outperform Logistic Regression on the Titanic dataset?
    options: ["They are more interpretable","They capture non-linear relationships","They require less compute","They are faster to train"]
    answer: 1
    explain: Random Forests can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features, which are common in real-world datasets like Titanic.
  - q: Which type of model is easiest to explain to a business stakeholder?
    options: ["Linear Regression","Gradient Boosting","Neural Network","Support Vector Machine"]
    answer: 0
    explain: Linear models are the most interpretable as they provide clear coefficients that show the direct impact of each feature on the prediction.

## Introduction
Choosing the right **model architecture** is one of the most important steps in any ML pipeline. Different models excel at different tasks, and understanding their strengths/weaknesses saves time and effort.

ðŸ‘‰ **Example:**
- Logistic regression â†’ interpretable, fast, good for linear problems
- Decision trees â†’ flexible, non-linear, but prone to overfitting  
- Neural networks â†’ powerful for complex patterns, but harder to train & explain

## Key Architectures

### Linear Models (Regression & Classification)
- **Pros**: Simple, interpretable, fast to train
- **Cons**: Poor for non-linear relationships
- **Best for**: Baseline models, tabular datasets with linear patterns

### Tree-Based Models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)
- **Pros**: Handle non-linearities, robust to scaling, work well with tabular data
- **Cons**: Can overfit, harder to interpret with boosting
- **Best for**: Structured/tabular datasets with mixed feature types

### Neural Networks
- **Pros**: Extremely flexible, handle unstructured data (images, text, audio)
- **Cons**: Require lots of data, computationally expensive, harder to interpret
- **Best for**: Computer vision, NLP, complex pattern recognition

## When to Use What

| Scenario | Best Choice | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Small dataset, linear relationships | Logistic/Linear Regression | Fast, interpretable baseline |
| Tabular dataset, mixed feature types | Random Forest / XGBoost | Handles categorical & numeric, robust |
| Image/text/audio data | Neural Networks (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) | Captures complex hierarchical patterns |
| High interpretability needed | Linear/Decision Trees | Easy to explain to stakeholders |
| Kaggle competitions | Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) | Often top-performing on structured data |

## Interactive Exploration
Use the **Dataset Explorer** and **Model Comparison Dashboard** to:
1. **Load Titanic dataset** and explore its characteristics
2. **Train 3 models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Small Neural Net)
3. **Compare performance** across accuracy, precision, recall, and inference time
4. **Reflect on trade-offs** between interpretability, speed, and accuracy

## Quiz
Test your understanding with the quiz questions above.

## Reflection
Think about a dataset you've worked with. Which model architecture would you choose and why? Consider the data size, complexity, and interpretability requirements.
