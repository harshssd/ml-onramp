goals:
  - Build a plain-language mental model of AI/ML
  - Distinguish rules-based vs learned systems
quiz:
  - q: Which best describes learning in ML?
    options: ["Write rules", "Fit parameters to reduce loss", "Memorize examples", "Try random actions"]
    answer: 1
    explain: Models adjust parameters to minimize loss on data.
tasks:
  - "Open the sandbox and lower MSE below 2.0"
reflection:
  - "Where do you see learned vs rule-based systems in your life?"

## Hook
AI systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or generate outputs. In this lesson, you'll build a mental model you can reuse across the course—then try a tiny interactive to lock it in.

## Concept (Plain → Precise)
**Plain:** AI learns patterns from data to guess well.  
**Precise:** Choose a function class; optimize parameters to minimize expected loss given data.

## Watch
[Embedded segment reinforces how models map inputs→outputs.]

## Checkpoint
(see quiz block)

## Do (5 min)
Try the Linear Regression Sandbox below. Drag the sliders and watch the fit and MSE update. This builds intuition before training.

## Reflect
What changes more: the *line* or the *error* when you nudge slope vs. intercept? How might noisy data affect the best-fit line?

## Next up
We'll explore data quality: splitting train/validation/test sets and why leakage ruins evaluations.
