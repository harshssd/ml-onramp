  - Evaluate models beyond metrics: cost, fairness, robustness
quiz:
  - q: Why might you prefer a slightly less accurate model in production?
    options: ["To reduce interpretability","To improve latency and cost efficiency","To increase dataset size","To reduce model complexity"]
    answer: 1
    explain: In production, latency and cost efficiency are often more important than marginal accuracy gains, especially for real-time applications.
  - q: Which technique reduces model size without retraining?
    options: ["Early Stopping","Quantization","Dropout","Regularization"]
    answer: 1
    explain: Quantization reduces model size by using fewer bits to represent weights without requiring retraining, unlike other techniques.
  - q: What is the purpose of shadow mode deployment?
    options: ["To increase training accuracy","To prevent overfitting","To test the model in production without affecting users","To reduce model size"]
    answer: 2
    explain: Shadow mode deployment allows testing a new model in production by running it alongside the current model without affecting user experience.
  - q: What is the primary benefit of model distillation?
    options: ["Increases accuracy","Reduces model size while maintaining performance","Prevents overfitting","Improves interpretability"]
    answer: 1
    explain: Model distillation creates smaller, faster models by training a student model to mimic a larger teacher model's behavior.

## Introduction
Training a high-performing model is only **half the battle**. The real challenge is deploying it into **production**, where:

- **Latency matters** (users expect responses in <200ms)
- **Costs matter** (GPU/CPU budgets are limited)
- **Interpretability matters** (stakeholders need trust)
- **Robustness matters** (drift, fairness, compliance)

## Key Production Considerations

### Accuracy vs Latency Trade-offs
- **Large neural networks** may give 1% better accuracy but take 10Ã— longer to run
- **Trade-offs depend on use case**: Real-time fraud detection vs offline forecasting
- **Benchmark both metrics** to make informed decisions
- **Consider user experience**: Fast, slightly less accurate models often perform better

### Model Compression Techniques
- **Pruning**: Remove weak connections or neurons to reduce model size
- **Quantization**: Use fewer bits to represent weights (e.g., 32-bit to 8-bit)
- **Distillation**: Train smaller model to mimic larger model's behavior
- **Benefits**: Lower latency, reduced memory usage, faster inference

### Interpretability vs Complexity
- **Linear/Tree models**: Naturally interpretable, easy to explain
- **Deep learning**: Black-box, requires tools (SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM)
- **Choose based on requirements**: Regulatory compliance vs performance
- **Consider audience**: Technical vs business stakeholders

### Robustness & Fairness
- **Bias testing**: Evaluate model performance across demographic groups
- **Adversarial robustness**: Test against malicious inputs
- **Edge case handling**: Ensure model works on unusual inputs
- **Data drift monitoring**: Detect when input distribution changes

### Deployment Readiness Checklist
- **SLA compliance**: Does model meet performance requirements?
- **Monitoring setup**: Can you track model performance in real-time?
- **Interpretability tools**: Are explanation methods available?
- **Bias testing**: Have fairness checks been completed?
- **Scalability**: Can model handle expected load?

## Production Scenarios

### Real-Time Systems
- **Priority**: Low latency, acceptable accuracy loss
- **Techniques**: Quantization, pruning, model compression
- **Examples**: Fraud detection, recommendation systems, chatbots
- **Constraints**: <200ms response time, high throughput

### Batch Processing
- **Priority**: High accuracy, latency less critical
- **Techniques**: Full precision, complex architectures
- **Examples**: Credit scoring, medical diagnosis, research
- **Constraints**: Processing time, computational resources

### Edge Deployment
- **Priority**: Small model size, low power consumption
- **Techniques**: Quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation
- **Examples**: Mobile apps, IoT devices, embedded systems
- **Constraints**: Memory, battery life, processing power

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Priority**: Interpretability, fairness, auditability
- **Techniques**: Linear models, decision trees, explainable AI
- **Examples**: Financial services, healthcare, legal
- **Constraints**: Regulatory requirements, documentation needs

## Best Practices

### 1. Benchmark Beyond Accuracy
- **Always measure latency and cost** alongside accuracy
- **Consider business metrics**: User satisfaction, conversion rates
- **Test on production-like data**: Real-world conditions matter
- **Monitor continuously**: Performance can degrade over time

### 2. Start Simple, Scale Up
- **Use lighter models** when scaling to millions of requests
- **Prove value first**: Start with simple models, add complexity as needed
- **Consider ensemble approaches**: Combine multiple simple models
- **Plan for growth**: Design systems that can scale

### 3. Deploy Gradually
- **Shadow mode first**: Test predictions silently before going live
- **A/B testing**: Compare new model with current one
- **Canary deployment**: Roll out to small percentage of users
- **Rollback plan**: Always have a way to revert changes

### 4. Build Feedback Loops
- **Continuous retraining**: Update model with new data
- **Performance monitoring**: Track metrics in real-time
- **User feedback**: Collect and incorporate user input
- **Data drift detection**: Identify when retraining is needed

## Interactive Exploration

1. **Compare Trade-offs**: Visualize accuracy vs latency vs model size
2. **Test Compression**: Apply pruning, quantization, and distillation
3. **Check Readiness**: Simulate production deployment checklist
4. **Explore Scenarios**: Test different production use cases
5. **Optimize for Production**: Find the best model for your constraints

## Production Metrics Beyond Accuracy

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: Response time for single prediction
- **Throughput**: Predictions per second
- **Resource usage**: CPU, memory, GPU utilization
- **Availability**: Uptime and reliability

### Business Metrics
- **User satisfaction**: Feedback and engagement
- **Conversion rates**: Business impact of predictions
- **Cost per prediction**: Economic efficiency
- **ROI**: Return on investment from model deployment

### Quality Metrics
- **Fairness**: Performance across demographic groups
- **Robustness**: Performance on edge cases
- **Interpretability**: Ability to explain predictions
- **Stability**: Consistency over time

## Common Production Pitfalls

### 1. Optimizing Only for Accuracy
- **Problem**: Focusing solely on accuracy metrics
- **Solution**: Consider latency, cost, and business impact
- **Example**: 99.5% accuracy with 5-second latency vs 99% accuracy with 50ms latency

### 2. Ignoring Model Size
- **Problem**: Deploying models that are too large for production
- **Solution**: Use compression techniques and size constraints
- **Example**: 1GB model for mobile app vs 10MB compressed model

### 3. Lack of Monitoring
- **Problem**: Deploying without performance tracking
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Example**: Model performance degrading over time without detection

### 4. Insufficient Testing
- **Problem**: Not testing on production-like data
- **Solution**: Use realistic test data and edge cases
- **Example**: Model works on clean data but fails on real-world inputs
