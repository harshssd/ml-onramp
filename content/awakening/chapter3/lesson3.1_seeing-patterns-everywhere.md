## Hook
Look around you. Everywhere you see patterns: the rhythm of footsteps, the arrangement of leaves, the flow of traffic. AI sees patterns too.

## Watch
Watch [Everyday Patterns in Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0e2HAPTGF4) (0â€“4 min).

## Do
Look for patterns in your environment. What patterns do you notice that a machine might also recognize?
