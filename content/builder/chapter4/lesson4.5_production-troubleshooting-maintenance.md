  - q: Which failure mode is most likely when upstream schema changes occur?
    options: ["Data pipeline failure","Model drift","Infrastructure bottleneck","Bias issue"]
    answer: 0
    explain: Schema changes in upstream sources typically cause data pipeline failures as the data format no longer matches expectations.
  - q: What is the primary purpose of incident documentation?

## Introduction
Even well-deployed models can fail in production. Failures can stem from:

- **Infrastructure issues** (server crash, scaling bottleneck)
- **Data issues** (bad schema, upstream pipeline errors)
- **Model issues** (drift, poor generalization, bias)

Troubleshooting and maintenance are about **reacting fast** and **ensuring stability**.
