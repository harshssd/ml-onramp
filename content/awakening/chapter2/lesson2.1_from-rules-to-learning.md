goals:
  - Understand difference between traditional programming and ML
  - Explain why rule-based systems fail at scale
quiz:
  - q: In programming, the rules are created by…
    options: ["Humans","Machines","Random chance","Data alone"]
    answer: 0
    explain: Humans code rules explicitly.
  - q: In machine learning, the rules are…
    options: ["Predefined","Learned from data","Static","Irrelevant"]
    answer: 1
    explain: ML systems infer rules from data.
flashcards:
  - Traditional Programming: Rules written by humans
  - Machine Learning: Rules inferred from data
reflection:
  - "Think of a task where coding all rules manually would be impossible (e.g., identifying cats in photos)."

## Hook
Imagine writing rules for every possible spam email. Impossible, right? This is where ML shines.

## Watch
Watch [ML Basics Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXHM_i-fgGo) (0–5 min).

## Do
Compare: Which tasks are easier with rules, which need learning? (spam filter, multiplication, chess, dog barking detector)
