quiz:
  - q: What's the main purpose of early stopping?
    options: ["To train faster","To stop when validation loss stops improving","To increase regularization strength","To reduce model size"]
    answer: 1
    explain: Early stopping prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss and stopping training when it stops improving, avoiding wasted computation.
  - q: Which regularization technique encourages sparsity in features?
    options: ["L1 Regularization","L2 Regularization","Dropout","Batch Normalization"]
    answer: 0
    explain: L1 regularization (Lasso) encourages sparsity by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.
  - q: Why might quantization be important in production?
    options: ["Improves accuracy","Reduces model size and inference latency","Prevents data leakage","Increases model interpretability"]
    answer: 1
    explain: Quantization reduces model size by using fewer bits to represent weights, which decreases memory usage and speeds up inference.
  - q: What is the primary benefit of dropout in neural networks?
    options: ["Faster training","Prevents overfitting by reducing co-adaptation","Increases model capacity","Reduces computational cost"]
    answer: 1
    explain: Dropout prevents overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training, forcing the network to not rely on specific neurons.

## Introduction
Once you've selected a model and tuned hyperparameters, the next challenge is **optimizing performance without overfitting**.

Optimization techniques help balance **generalization, efficiency, and reliability** for production-ready models.

## Core Optimization Techniques

### Regularization (L1/L2)
- **Purpose**: Prevents coefficients from becoming too large
- **L1 (Lasso)**: Encourages sparsity by driving some coefficients to zero (feature selection)
- **L2 (Ridge)**: Shrinks coefficients evenly without eliminating features
- **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 and L2 regularization
- **Best for**: Preventing overfitting, feature selection (L1), general regularization (L2)

### Early Stopping
- **Purpose**: Stop training when validation loss stops improving
- **Benefits**: Prevents overfitting, saves computational resources
- **Implementation**: Monitor validation loss, stop when it plateaus or increases
- **Best for**: Neural networks, gradient boosting, any iterative training

### Dropout (Neural Networks)
- **Purpose**: Randomly disable neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation
- **Benefits**: Improves generalization, reduces overfitting
- **Implementation**: Randomly set neurons to zero during training
- **Best for**: Deep neural networks, overfitting prevention

### Pruning & Quantization
- **Pruning**: Remove weak connections or neurons to reduce model size
- **Quantization**: Reduce precision of weights (e.g., 32-bit to 8-bit)
- **Benefits**: Lower latency, reduced memory usage, faster inference
- **Best for**: Production deployment, edge devices, real-time systems

### Learning Rate Scheduling
- **Purpose**: Gradually decrease learning rate during training
- **Strategies**: Step decay, exponential decay, cosine annealing
- **Benefits**: Prevents overshooting minima, improves convergence
- **Best for**: Deep learning, fine-tuning, optimization stability

## Best Practices

### 1. Monitor Validation Metrics
- **Always track validation loss** alongside training loss
- **Use learning curves** to identify overfitting/underfitting
- **Set up early stopping** with appropriate patience

### 2. Regularization Strategy
- **Start with L2** for general overfitting prevention
- **Use L1** when feature selection is important
- **Combine techniques** (e.g., dropout + L2 regularization)

### 3. Production Considerations
- **Test optimization trade-offs** on real-world constraints
- **Consider latency requirements** for your use case
- **Balance accuracy vs efficiency** based on deployment needs

### 4. Systematic Approach
- **Apply one technique at a time** to understand individual effects
- **Use performance dashboards** to compare impact
- **Document trade-offs** for future reference

## Interactive Exploration
Use the **Optimization Lab** and **Performance Trade-off Explorer** to:

1. **Apply Regularization**: Test L1/L2 effects on Logistic Regression weights
2. **Experiment with Dropout**: Train neural networks with and without dropout
3. **Test Early Stopping**: Find optimal stopping thresholds
4. **Explore Trade-offs**: Visualize accuracy vs latency vs model size
5. **Compare Techniques**: See which optimizations work best for your data

## Optimization by Model Type

### Linear Models
- **Regularization**: L1 for feature selection, L2 for general overfitting
- **Feature Scaling**: Important for regularization to work effectively
- **Cross-validation**: Use CV to select optimal regularization strength

### Tree-Based Models
- **Pruning**: Remove weak branches to prevent overfitting
- **Early Stopping**: Stop boosting when validation performance plateaus
- **Feature Importance**: Use for feature selection and model interpretation

### Neural Networks
- **Dropout**: Apply to hidden layers, not output layer
- **Batch Normalization**: Stabilize training and allow higher learning rates
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Essential for deep networks
- **Weight Decay**: L2 regularization for neural network weights

### Ensemble Methods
- **Early Stopping**: Critical for gradient boosting
- **Regularization**: Use in base learners (e.g., trees in random forest)
- **Model Selection**: Choose optimal number of base models

## Production Optimization Strategies

### Real-Time Systems
- **Priority**: Low latency, acceptable accuracy loss
- **Techniques**: Quantization, pruning, model compression
- **Considerations**: Hardware constraints, inference speed

### Batch Processing
- **Priority**: High accuracy, latency less critical
- **Techniques**: Full precision, complex architectures
- **Considerations**: Computational resources, processing time

### Edge Deployment
- **Priority**: Small model size, low power consumption
- **Techniques**: Quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation
- **Considerations**: Memory constraints, battery life

## Common Optimization Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Regularization
- **Problem**: Too much regularization causes underfitting
- **Solution**: Use cross-validation to find optimal strength
- **Signs**: High bias, poor performance on both train and validation

### 2. Premature Early Stopping
- **Problem**: Stopping too early prevents model from learning
- **Solution**: Set appropriate patience and monitor learning curves
- **Signs**: Underfitting, poor convergence

### 3. Ignoring Production Constraints
- **Problem**: Optimizing only for accuracy, ignoring deployment needs
- **Solution**: Consider latency, memory, and computational requirements
- **Signs**: Model too slow or large for production use

### 4. Inconsistent Optimization
- **Problem**: Applying different techniques inconsistently
- **Solution**: Use systematic approach, document all changes
- **Signs**: Unreproducible results, unclear performance gains
