goals:
  - Understand why cross-validation is essential for reliable evaluation
  - Learn the differences between k-fold, stratified, and time-series CV
  - Apply CV strategies to avoid data leakage and overfitting
  - Visualize how folds impact performance stability
quiz:
  - q: Why is stratified CV preferred for classification tasks?
    options: ["It runs faster","It preserves class distribution in folds","It uses fewer folds","It requires less memory"]
    answer: 1
    explain: Stratified CV ensures that each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset, which is crucial for reliable evaluation on imbalanced datasets.
  - q: Why should test data be excluded from CV?
    options: ["To ensure unbiased final evaluation","To speed up training","To increase variance in folds","To reduce memory usage"]
    answer: 0
    explain: Test data should be kept completely separate from CV to ensure an unbiased final evaluation. Using test data in CV would lead to overly optimistic performance estimates.
  - q: Which CV strategy is most appropriate for stock price prediction?
    options: ["Stratified CV","Random CV","Time-Series CV","Leave-One-Out CV"]
    answer: 2
    explain: Time-series CV is essential for temporal data because it respects the chronological order and uses past data to predict future values, which is the natural way to evaluate time-series models.
  - q: What is the main advantage of k-fold CV over holdout validation?
    options: ["It's faster to compute","It uses all data for both training and validation","It requires less memory","It's easier to implement"]
    answer: 1
    explain: K-fold CV uses all available data for both training and validation by rotating through different folds, providing more reliable performance estimates than a single train-test split.

## Introduction
Splitting data into **train** and **test** is often not enough. If the split is unlucky, results may not generalize.

ðŸ‘‰ **Cross-validation (CV)** helps by evaluating models on multiple folds of the data, giving a more stable estimate of performance.

## Key CV Strategies

### K-Fold Cross-Validation
- **How it works**: Split dataset into `k` folds (e.g., 5), train on `k-1` folds, test on remaining fold
- **Pros**: Uses all data for both training and validation, more reliable than single split
- **Cons**: Computationally expensive, can be slow for large datasets
- **Best for**: General purpose, when you have sufficient data

### Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
- **How it works**: Same as k-fold, but preserves **class balance** in each fold
- **Pros**: Essential for imbalanced datasets, more reliable performance estimates
- **Cons**: Slightly more complex to implement
- **Best for**: Classification problems with imbalanced classes

### Time-Series Cross-Validation
- **How it works**: Use past data to predict future, never shuffle temporal data
- **Pros**: Respects temporal order, realistic evaluation for time-series
- **Cons**: Cannot use future data to predict past, less data per fold
- **Best for**: Time-series data, stock prices, weather prediction

### Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)
- **How it works**: Use all but one sample for training, test on the remaining sample
- **Pros**: Uses maximum data for training, unbiased estimate
- **Cons**: Very computationally expensive, high variance
- **Best for**: Small datasets where you need maximum data usage

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Strategy
- **Classification with balanced classes**: Use k-fold CV
- **Classification with imbalanced classes**: Use stratified k-fold CV
- **Time-series data**: Use time-series CV
- **Small datasets**: Consider LOOCV or higher k values

### 2. Set Appropriate Number of Folds
- **Small datasets**: Use higher k (e.g., 10-fold or LOOCV)
- **Large datasets**: 3-5 folds are usually sufficient
- **Imbalanced data**: Use stratified k-fold with 5-10 folds

### 3. Avoid Data Leakage
- **Never use test data in CV**: Keep a final holdout set
- **For time-series**: Ensure temporal order is preserved
- **For feature engineering**: Apply transformations within each fold

### 4. Monitor Performance Stability
- **Check fold variance**: High variance indicates unstable model
- **Compare CV scores**: Look for consistent performance across folds
- **Validate assumptions**: Ensure CV strategy matches your use case

## Interactive Exploration
Use the **CV Visualizer** and **Transform Preview** to:

1. **Apply 5-fold CV** to Titanic dataset using Logistic Regression
2. **Switch to Stratified CV** and observe balanced evaluation
3. **Explore Time-Series CV** with simulated sequential data
4. **Visualize variance** in metrics across different folds
5. **Compare strategies** and understand when to use each

## Common CV Pitfalls

### 1. Data Leakage
- **Problem**: Using future information to predict past events
- **Solution**: Ensure proper temporal ordering and feature engineering within folds

### 2. Overfitting to CV
- **Problem**: Optimizing hyperparameters on CV scores too aggressively
- **Solution**: Use nested CV or separate validation set

### 3. Wrong CV Strategy
- **Problem**: Using random CV for time-series data
- **Solution**: Choose CV strategy that matches your data characteristics

### 4. Insufficient Folds
- **Problem**: Using too few folds for small datasets
- **Solution**: Use more folds or LOOCV for small datasets

## CV for Different Model Types

### Linear Models
- **Stratified CV**: Essential for logistic regression
- **Regularization**: Tune within each fold to avoid overfitting

### Tree-Based Models
- **K-fold CV**: Works well with random forests
- **Feature importance**: Can be calculated across folds

### Neural Networks
- **Early stopping**: Use validation set within each fold
- **Data augmentation**: Apply within training folds only

### Ensemble Methods
- **Stacking**: Use CV to create meta-features
- **Blending**: Use CV to determine optimal weights
