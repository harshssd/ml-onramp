goals:
  - Run Python safely in the browser
  - Manipulate lists/dicts; compute a simple statistic
quiz:
  - q: What does `len()` return for `[2,4,6]`?
    options: ["2","3","6","Error"]
    answer: 1
    explain: `len` returns the number of elements → 3.
  - q: Average of `[1,2,5]` is:
    options: ["2","2.5","8","1.5"]
    answer: 1
    explain: (1+2+5)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.67 (trick!) Watch rounding vs exact.
tasks:
  - "Modify the snippet to compute mean & median of a list you enter."
reflection:
  - "What's one dataset from your life you'd like to summarize?"

## Hook
Let's run real Python with zero setup.

## Concept
We'll edit 3 lines and see output immediately. You'll use lists/dicts—building blocks for later data work.

## Do (Pyodide snippet)
```python
# You can edit the nums list and re-run.
nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]   # ← try your own
mean = sum(nums) / len(nums)

# TODO: compute the median (hint: sort then pick middle or average two)
print("Count:", len(nums))
print("Mean:", round(mean, 3))
```

*(Your app renders the `pyodide_snippet` widget beneath this section.)*
