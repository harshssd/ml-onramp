goals:
  - Understand difference between programming and ML
  - Explain role of data in machine learning
quiz:
  - q: Traditional programming is…
    options: ["Rules → Data → Output","Data + Output → Rules","Rules + Data → Output"]
    answer: 0
    explain: Programming encodes rules directly.
  - q: Machine Learning is…
    options: ["Rules + Data → Output","Data + Output → Rules","Output + Rules → Data"]
    answer: 1
    explain: ML derives rules from data and outputs.
flashcards:

  - Training Data: Examples used to teach
reflection:
  - "Think of a problem you'd like a machine to learn. What data would it need?"
